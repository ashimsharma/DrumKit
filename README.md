# Drum Kit

A web application which allows the users to record play and record drum kit sounds and save the recorded sounds on a remote database for later access.







## Appendix

### Project Overview
This Drum Kit project is a full-stack web application that allows users to play, record, and manage drum sounds interactively. It is built using modern web technologies to provide a seamless and secure user experience.

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend:**  
  Developed with **React**, providing a dynamic and responsive user interface with component-based architecture.

- **Backend:**  
  Built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**, serving as the RESTful API layer that handles business logic and client requests.

- **Database:**  
  Uses **MongoDB** for data persistence, storing user information, session data, and any user-generated content securely and efficiently.

- **Authentication:**  
  Implements **JWT (JSON Web Token)** based authentication to ensure secure, stateless user sessions and protect API endpoints.

### Key Features

- Responsive drum kit interface with sound playback on key press or click.
- User authentication and authorization with JWT.
- Persistent user data stored in MongoDB.
- REST API architecture separating frontend and backend concerns.

### Deployment

The application is deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com) (frontend) and a Node.js server (deployed on an Amazon AWS EC2 instance) (backend), ensuring scalability and fast response times.
